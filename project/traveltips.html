        <p style="font-size: x-large;">
          Traveling to Nepal can be an incredible and rewarding experience. It's
          a country known for its stunning landscapes, rich culture, and warm
          hospitality. Here are some essential travel tips to help you make the
          most of your trip to Nepal:
          <ul>
            <li style="font-size:x-large;"><u>Visa and Entry Requirements:</u>Check the visa requirements for your nationality before you travel. Most visitors can obtain a visa on arrival at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu or at land border crossings. Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your intended departure date.</li><br><br>
            <li style="font-size:x-large;"><u>Travel Insurance:</u>It's highly recommended to have comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical expenses, emergency evacuation, and other potential mishaps. Nepal's terrain can be challenging, so insurance is crucial.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li style="font-size: x-large;"><u>Health Precautions:</u>Consult a travel clinic or your healthcare provider before your trip to get advice on vaccinations and health precautions for Nepal. Carry any necessary medications and a basic first aid kit.</li><br><br>
            <li style="font-size:x-large ;"><u>Currency and Money:</u>The official currency of Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR). While major cities have ATMs, it's a good idea to carry some cash, especially when traveling to remote areas where ATMs might be scarce.</li><br><br>
            <li style="font-size:x-large;"><u>Transportation:</u>Nepal's road infrastructure can be challenging, so be prepared for bumpy rides if you're traveling by road. Domestic flights are also common, especially for reaching remote areas quickly.</li><br><br>
            <li style="font-size:x-large;"><u>Communication:</u>While Wi-Fi is available in many hotels and restaurants, connectivity might be limited in remote areas. Consider getting a local SIM card for your phone for better communication.</li><br><br>
